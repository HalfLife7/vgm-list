## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

---

## Requirements

For development, you will need Node.js (14+), a node package manager installed in your environment and PostgreSQL.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

```
    $ node --version
    v14.8

    $ npm --version
    6.14.5
```

## Install

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/HalfLife7/vgm-list
    $ cd vgm-list
    $ cd client
    $ npm install
    $ cd ../server
    $ npm install
    $ knex migrate:latest
    $ knex seed:run
```

## Configure app

Open `vgm-list/server/.env.example` and `vgm-list/client/.env.example`then edit it with your settings and rename to ONLY '.env'. You will need:

```
- DATABASE_URL = postgres://DATABASE_USER_NAME:DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/DATABASE_NAME (replace with your Postgres connection string)
```

## Running the project in development

You will need 2 terminals to run the project (one for the backend and one for the front-end)

```
    $ cd server
    $ npm run watch:dev
```

```
    $ cd client
    $ npm run serve
```
